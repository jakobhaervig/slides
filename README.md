# README

Build slides using markdown, whilst adhering to the principles learned from the [How to avoid death By PowerPoint](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iwpi1Lm6dFo) TEDx Talk.

You can see the slides of this repository as a demo at https://hogenttin.github.io/hogent-markdown-slides/ . Play with it to see what it can do!

## Basic usage

### Installation

1. Install [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. (optional) Create a [python environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html). E.g. for Linux:

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source ./venv/bin/activate
    ```

3. Install [mkslides](https://pypi.org/project/mkslides/):

    ```bash
    pip install mkslides
    ```

### How do I use this?

Edit, add or delete your markdown files in the [docs](./docs/) directory, and run `mkslides build docs/` to generate the website in the [site](./site) folder. **That's all to get started!** :rocket:

### Live preview

`mkslides` allows you to start up a live preview, so you can instantly see how your slides look like whilst editing the markdown files.

To start a local webserver with live reloading:

```bash
mkslides serve docs/
```
